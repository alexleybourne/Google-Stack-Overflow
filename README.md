# Google stack overflow chrome extension

Why google it if you know you're going to end up at stack overflow üíª

Press the magic button to find the solution to all your problems ( hopefully )

If you are looking to make your own extension or have a go modifying this one.
I have commented all the code to make it nice and easy to understand / navigate üòÅ
